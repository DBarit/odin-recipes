    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Katsu, a popular Japanese comfort food of breaded cutlets, is commonly made with chicken or pork.
        For this chicken version, boneless chicken breasts are pounded thin, dredged in flour, egg and panko, then fried
        until golden brown for an irresistible crispy crust that yields to — and protects — juicy meat inside.
        The traditional accompaniments are a mound of crunchy shredded cabbage, steamed rice and a generous drizzle of
        sweet-savory katsu sauce.
        Also called tonkatsu sauce, it’s a tangy Japanese-style barbecue sauce made with soy sauce, Worcestershire
        sauce, tomatoes, ginger and clove.
        Though you can purchase bottles of it in Asian markets or online, the sauce is easy to make, lasts indefinitely
        in the fridge and serves as a great all-purpose dip.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Chicken:</h3>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups panko</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, butterflied and cut into 4 cutlets</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li> 2 cups finely sliced cabbage</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
        <li>4 lemon wedges</li>
        <h3>Katsu Sauce:</h3>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the katsu sauce: Stir together the ketchup, Worcestershire and soy sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>For the chicken: Set a wire rack in a baking sheet or line a large plate with a paper towel and set aside.
            Place the flour, eggs and panko into 3 separate large shallow bowls.
            Stir together 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and then sprinkle the mixture on both
            sides of the cutlets.
            Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge it in the flour, dip it into the eggs, and then coat it with the
            panko, gently pressing both sides into the panko to make sure it adheres well.
            Transfer the cutlet to a plate and repeat with the remaining cutlets.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until it reaches about 350 degrees F on a deep-fry
            thermometer.
            (To test for readiness, sprinkle a few pieces of panko into the oil. It should bubble vigorously.)
        </li>
        <li>Working with 2 cutlets at a time to prevent crowding, cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides,
            about 3 minutes per side.
            Transfer to the prepared wire rack or plate, season with salt and let rest for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat
            with the remaining 2 cutlets. (See Cook’s Note.)
        </li>
        <li>Slice each cutlet crosswise into 1/2-inch strips, lay on a bed of sliced cabbage and serve with the katsu
            sauce, rice and a lemon wedge.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>These cutlets are great for freezing for make-ahead meals: Cook the cutlets, but don’t slice them.
        Let cool completely and then freeze in a plastic bag, placing parchment paper between the pieces to prevent
        sticking.
        They will keep for up to 3 months. To reheat, place on a baking sheet in a 350 degree F oven until heated
        through and crispy, about 15 minutes. Slice before serving.
